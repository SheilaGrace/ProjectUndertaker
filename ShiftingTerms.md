# 《Types of Therians》

There are various types of **Therians**. Due to the significant variability in individual experiences and the inherently subjective nature of most **Therian** experiences, it is practically impossible to question their authenticity. While some are skeptical about the need to document each individual's experience, as data accumulates, commonalities among **Therians** have emerged. The types introduced here are those commonly experienced by a significant number of **Therians**. Understanding one's characteristics as a **Therian** may provide clues for deeper self-understanding.



## 【Standard Therian】 / 【Shifter】
A **Therian** with only one **Theriotype**. This category includes **Therians** who experience **Shifting**. It is the most common type of **Therian**, hence the term *"Standard"*. Many experience **Mental Shifts**, **Phantom Shifts**, and **Dream Shifts**.



## 【Polytherian】

A **Therian** with multiple **Theriotypes**. Most **Polytherians** have two **Theriotypes**, but in rare cases, they may have more. However, there are few *"true"* **Polytherians** with more than five **Theriotypes**. **Therians** or **Otherkin** who believe they have many **Theriotypes** may be projecting themselves onto other species or characters excessively, or they might not have a well-developed self-understanding, adding unnecessary traits to their identity. They might also be **Otherhearted** or **Copinglinkers** rather than true **Therians**.

**Polytherians** have complex characteristics. Some may have a single dominant **Theriotype** with other traits rarely manifesting, some may display all their **Theriotypes** with equal frequency, while others might have *"blended"* characteristics. Whether a *"main"* **Theriotype** is clear, and whether *"subtypes"* are respected as part of the identity or considered ignorable minor aspects, largely depends on personal perspective. During the process of self-understanding, some **Theriotypes** may turn out to be *Hearted Types*, leading to a more integrated understanding of their **Theriotypes**.

Additionally, depending on their environment, they may acquire features not inherent to their original **Theriotype**. For instance, in a severely stressful environment, they might imagine *wings* as symbols of freedom or *horns* as symbols of power. These additional features might disappear when their environment improves, and stress is alleviated. Changing from a *"winged wolf"* or *"draconic wolf"* to just a *"wolf"* is a typical example of this pattern.

Incidentally, if any of their multiple **Kintypes** are **Otherkin**, they usually choose to identify as either **Therian** or **Otherkin**. This aspect contributes to the blurred lines between **Therians** and **Otherkin**.



## 【Nonshifting Therian】

A **Therian** who does not experience **Shifting**. They define themselves as animals through concepts other than **Shifting**. They are pretty rare cases.



## 【Contherian】

A **Therian** who always perceives themselves in an *"animal state"* (constantly in a **Mental Shift**). Contherians experience **Shifting** like other **Therians**, but they never *"shift back to a human state"*. Contherians can be classified into the following two categories.



### 【Suntherian】 / 【Vacillant】

Among **Contherians** who are always in an animal state, this term refers to those who can shift to a *"somewhat human-like mental state"* or a *"hybrid state of animal and human thinking"*. However, this does not mean they experience a distinct **Mental Shift** like **Standard Therians**. For **Otherkin**, this is called **Vacillant**.

The **Mental Shifts** of **Standard Therians** are considered more *"dramatic"* mental changes, while **Suntherians** experience more seamless, spectrum-like changes. Being in a *"100% animal state"* might cause issues when interacting with humans, so it is desirable for both **Therians** and **Otherkin** to be able to control their **Mental Shifts** to some extent. However, performing *"human acts"* can significantly trigger **Species Dysphoria** in **Therians** and **Otherkin**, so it is preferable for them to learn some coping strategies. **Standard Therians** are believed to manage this by clearly distinguishing between *"performing as a human"* and *"being their true self"*. **Suntherians** might use a coping strategy of pseudo-recognizing "everyone around them, including themselves", as *"animals other than humans"* to some extent, thus avoiding or overcoming **Species Dysphoria** and social anxiety.



### 【Cladotherian】

**Therians** who do not believe that their **Theriotype** is a specific existing animal species on Earth. For example, they do not identify specifically as a *"tiger"*, *"lion"*, or *"cheetah"*, but rather broadly as an *"anthro feline"*. This is not a transitional state of not yet identifying their *"exact"* **Theriotype**, but rather **Cladotherians** inherently believe that their **Theriotype** cannot be identified as a *specific species*, or they do not believe they are an existing animal species. The recognition that *"I am an anthro"* is central to **Cladotherians**, making them more similar to **Otherkin** or **Fictionkin** than to traditional **Therians**.

In Japan, the term *"Kemono"* is widely recognized to refer to *anthro characters*. The **Theriotype** of **Cladotherians** corresponds to this *"Kemono"*, and they likely identify themselves as *"Kemono"*. They generally consider themselves as *"anthro canine"* or *"anthro feline"*, with little interest in specific dog or cat breeds and few attempts to explore these details. *"Anthros"* are considered beings with both human and animal characteristics, so **Cladotherians** can interact with humans *"normally as anthro"* without consciously undergoing a **Mental Shift**, thus avoiding **Species Dysphoria** and social relationship troubles. In a way, this identity system is highly optimized for *"adapting to human society"*.



# 《Types of Shifting》

## 【Mental Shift】

Perhaps the most familiar type of **shift** for **Therians** and **Otherkin**. The mental state shifts to an *"animal state"*, and one perceives themselves closer to their **Theriotype**. This can result in a strong urge to engage in animalistic behaviors such as barking or biting. These behaviors can become problematic if acted upon in public, so learning to control a **Mental Shift** is crucial for the psychological well-being of **Therians** and **Otherkin** living near human populations. Though this is addressed in both **Spiritual Therianthropy** and **Psychological Therianthropy**, recent studies have made more in-depth progress in the **Psychological Therianthropy** field.

Suppressing these urges can often lead to significant stress buildup. Therefore, it is generally preferable for individuals to find ways to express their animalistic urges. Some coping strategies include:

1. Building an avatar of their **Theriotype** in metaverse platforms like *SecondLife* or *VRChat* to spend more time as their *"true self"*.

2. Engaging in conversations with other **Therians** or **Otherkin** to create environments where they can be their true selves.

3. Releasing animalistic urges in secluded natural settings.

4. Engaging in creative activities that represent their **Theriotype** to express their own **Therianthropy**.

5. Performing intentional **Phantom Shifts** through **Meditation** to strongly connect with their **Theriotype** for self-fulfillment.

6. Making physical contact with similar species of animals to one's **Theriotype**, like dogs or cats.

7. Consuming content related to their **Theriotype**, such as art, movies, music, or literature.

8. Relaxing by watching videos or listening to music that evokes nature if natural environments are unavailable.

9. Writing down thoughts on Therianthropy in a journal.

Addressing **Species Dysphoria** through these methods is advisable.

Future advancements in *AR* technology may allow people to freely change avatars, potentially significantly reducing **Species Dysphoria** by always wearing an avatar that matches their **Theriotype**.



## 【Phantom Shift】

The term *"phantom"* in **Phantom Shift** refers to the **"Phantom Limb"** experienced by individuals. This shift involves seeing or feeling **Phantom Limbs** of one's **Theriotype**, such as feeling a *tail* or *paw pads*. While no physical change occurs, sensitive **Therians** and **Otherkin** report being able to perceive others' **Phantom Limbs**. Reports also suggest that infants and animals, such as dogs and cats, may sense these **Phantom Limbs**. This has led to the hypothesis that **Phantom Shifts** involve abilities humans lost through evolution or growth. Studies seeking to understand these *"lost abilities"* potentially develop **Neurological Therianthropy** discovery.

**Phantom Shifts** are primarily considered a part of **Spiritual Therianthropy**, and it is believed they can be *"trained"* to some extent through **Meditation** and *imagery exercises*. The duration and intensity of these sensations depend significantly on the individual's condition. Spiritual experiences like **Astral Shift** can sometimes dramatically enhance the intensity of these sensations. While generally a pleasant experience for most **Therians** and **Otherkin**, the inability to maintain **Phantom Limbs** can risk experiencing **Species Dysphoria**.



## 【Dream Shift】

A shift experienced in dreams where one becomes their **Theriotype**. With training in controlling dream content, one might be able to intentionally experience **Dream Shifts**. Without special training, **Dream Shifts** are typically involuntary. Experiences include running through mountains at incredible speeds or seeing the world from a low perspective.



## 【Cameo Shift】

An exceptional shift where one temporarily shifts to an animal species that is ***not*** their **Theriotype**. This can involve intense **Mental Shifts** or **Phantom Shifts**, leading to misidentification of one's **Theriotype**. **Cameo Shifts** can occur briefly or persist for years, often triggered by changes in environment or psychological state, and may cease once the stress is alleviated.



## 【Astral Shift】

A spiritual shift encompassing various spiritual experiences related to **Therianthropy**. Some specific **Dream Shifts** can be part of **Astral Shifts**, as can communication with **Spirit Guides**. This area is mainly addressed by **Spiritual Therianthropy**. **Astral Shifts** often occur during deep **Meditation**, sleep, or trance states, though some individuals possess the special ability to communicate daily with their **Spirit Guides**. While not everyone experiences **Astral Shifts**, those skeptical of *ghosts* or *spirits* may actively deny them. Individual beliefs outside of **Therianthropy** can also influence the likelihood of experiencing **Astral Shifts**.



## 【Sensory Shift】

A shift where sensory organs become heightened, approaching the senses of one's **Theriotype**. Typically olfactory and hearing senses intensity, but rarely reported the lack of color recognition. Reactions vary; some **Therians** welcome **Sensory Shifts**, while others find them unpleasant. When viewed negatively, **Sensory Shifts** may be considered similar to the *"sensory overload"* discussed in modern psychology. Like **Mental Shifts**, uncontrolled **Sensory Shifts** can disrupt daily life, so learning voluntary control is important.

**Psychological Therianthropy** suggests that **Sensory Shifts** occur not through physical enhancement of senses but by unlocking the body's potential to its limits. They often accompany **Mental Shifts**, potentially seen as part of an instinctive **"Fight or Flight"** response, making the individual more alert to perceived threats. Creating a psychological safe zone, where the individual feels secure, can help control **Sensory Shifts**. Supportive protection from others is ideal.
