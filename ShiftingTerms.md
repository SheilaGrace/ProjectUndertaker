# 《Types of Therians》

There are various types of **Therians**. Due to the significant variability in individual experiences and the inherently subjective nature of most **Therian** experiences, it is practically impossible to question their authenticity. While some are skeptical about the need to document each individual's experience, as data accumulates, commonalities among **Therians** have emerged. The types introduced here are those commonly experienced by a significant number of **Therians**. Understanding one's characteristics as a **Therian** may provide clues for deeper self-understanding.



## 【Standard Therian】 / 【Shifter】
A **Therian** with only one **Theriotype**. This category includes **Therians** who experience **Shifting**. It is the most common type of **Therian**, hence the term *"Standard"*. Many experience **Mental Shifts**, **Phantom Shifts**, and **Dream Shifts**.



## 【Polytherian】

A **Therian** with multiple **Theriotypes**. Most **Polytherians** have two **Theriotypes**, but in rare cases, they may have more. However, there are few *"true"* **Polytherians** with more than five **Theriotypes**. **Therians** or **Otherkin** who believe they have many **Theriotypes** may be projecting themselves onto other species or characters excessively, or they might not have a well-developed self-understanding, adding unnecessary traits to their identity. They might also be **Otherhearted** or **Copinglinkers** rather than true **Therians**.

**Polytherians** have complex characteristics. Some may have a single dominant **Theriotype** with other traits rarely manifesting, some may display all their **Theriotypes** with equal frequency, while others might have *"blended"* characteristics. Whether a *"main"* **Theriotype** is clear, and whether *"subtypes"* are respected as part of the identity or considered ignorable minor aspects, largely depends on personal perspective. During the process of self-understanding, some **Theriotypes** may turn out to be *Hearted Types*, leading to a more integrated understanding of their **Theriotypes**.

Additionally, depending on their environment, they may acquire features not inherent to their original **Theriotype**. For instance, in a severely stressful environment, they might imagine *wings* as symbols of freedom or *horns* as symbols of power. These additional features might disappear when their environment improves, and stress is alleviated. Changing from a *"winged wolf"* or *"draconic wolf"* to just a *"wolf"* is a typical example of this pattern.

Incidentally, if any of their multiple **Kintypes** are **Otherkin**, they usually choose to identify as either **Therian** or **Otherkin**. This aspect contributes to the blurred lines between **Therians** and **Otherkin**.



## 【Nonshifting Therian】

A **Therian** who does not experience **Shifting**. They define themselves as animals through concepts other than **Shifting**. They are pretty rare cases.



## 【Contherian】

A **Therian** who always perceives themselves in an *"animal state"* (constantly in a **Mental Shift**). Contherians experience **Shifting** like other **Therians**, but they never *"shift back to a human state"*. Contherians can be classified into the following two categories.



### 【Suntherian】 / 【Vacillant】

Among **Contherians** who are always in an animal state, this term refers to those who can shift to a *"somewhat human-like mental state"* or a *"hybrid state of animal and human thinking"*. However, this does not mean they experience a distinct **Mental Shift** like **Standard Therians**. For **Otherkin**, this is called **Vacillant**.

The **Mental Shifts** of **Standard Therians** are considered more *"dramatic"* mental changes, while **Suntherians** experience more seamless, spectrum-like changes. Being in a *"100% animal state"* might cause issues when interacting with humans, so it is desirable for both **Therians** and **Otherkin** to be able to control their **Mental Shifts** to some extent. However, performing *"human acts"* can significantly trigger **Species Dysphoria** in **Therians** and **Otherkin**, so it is preferable for them to learn some coping strategies. **Standard Therians** are believed to manage this by clearly distinguishing between *"performing as a human"* and *"being their true self"*. **Suntherians** might use a coping strategy of pseudo-recognizing "everyone around them, including themselves", as *"animals other than humans"* to some extent, thus avoiding or overcoming **Species Dysphoria** and social anxiety.



### 【Cladotherian】

**Therians** who do not believe that their **Theriotype** is a specific existing animal species on Earth. For example, they do not identify specifically as a *"tiger"*, *"lion"*, or *"cheetah"*, but rather broadly as an *"anthro feline"*. This is not a transitional state of not yet identifying their *"exact"* **Theriotype**, but rather **Cladotherians** inherently believe that their **Theriotype** cannot be identified as a *specific species*, or they do not believe they are an existing animal species. The recognition that *"I am an anthro"* is central to **Cladotherians**, making them more similar to **Otherkin** or **Fictionkin** than to traditional **Therians**.

In Japan, the term *"Kemono"* is widely recognized to refer to *anthro characters*. The **Theriotype** of **Cladotherians** corresponds to this *"Kemono"*, and they likely identify themselves as *"Kemono"*. They generally consider themselves as *"anthro canine"* or *"anthro feline"*, with little interest in specific dog or cat breeds and few attempts to explore these details. *"Anthros"* are considered beings with both human and animal characteristics, so **Cladotherians** can interact with humans *"normally as anthro"* without consciously undergoing a **Mental Shift**, thus avoiding **Species Dysphoria** and social relationship troubles. In a way, this identity system is highly optimized for *"adapting to human society"*.
