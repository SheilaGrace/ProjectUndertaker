# 《Types of Therians》

There are various types of **Therians**. Due to the significant variability in individual experiences and the inherently subjective nature of most Therian experiences, it is practically impossible to question their authenticity. While some are skeptical about the need to document each individual's experience, as data accumulates, commonalities among Therians have emerged. The types introduced here are those commonly experienced by a significant number of Therians. Understanding one's characteristics as a Therian may provide clues for deeper self-understanding.

Standard Therian / Shifter
A Therian with only one Theriotype. This category includes Therians who experience Shifting. It is the most common type of Therian, hence the term "Standard." Many experience Mental Shifts, Phantom Shifts, and Dream Shifts.
