# Supporting Therians

When supporting **Therians**, the most important principle is unconditional acceptance.

Ideally, this role should be guaranteed by parents, but due to the increasing nuclear family structure and the rise in single-parent households, it is becoming difficult for children to experience unconditional acceptance. Additionally, it is not uncommon for parents themselves to be psychologically oppressed or have some mental issues, leading many children to find themselves in crisis due to their parents' inability to provide adequate support.

In such cases, it would be ideal if government or support organizations could intervene and provide assistance. However, the reality is that not all children receive sufficient aid. Specifically, in Japan, there are almost no parents or support organizations that can offer appropriate assistance with an understanding of the unique nature of Therians. Therefore, even if a Therian manages to obtain support from an organization, it is uncertain whether this will truly help them. There are cases where the individual may cause trouble with the support organization and end up isolated.

Therefore, supporters should first act as surrogate mothers. Considering that Therians often have severe mistrust of humans, it is desirable to take time to remove their wariness and gradually build trust. An approach akin to "rescuing abused animals to a shelter" might be more effective for Therians than the traditional "supporting humans" method. Many Therians have experienced Awakening out of necessity due to constantly being in critical situations that demand to keep their animal instincts in an active state. Supporters should be prepared to deal with "injured beasts" rather than just "mentally wounded people."

There are countless examples of rescued animals opening their hearts to humans and building friendly relationships. Such special experiences will be the greatest reward for supporters.
