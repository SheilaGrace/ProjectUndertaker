# 《Therianthropy Terminology》

## 【Therianthropy】

Therianthropy is the phenomenon of considering or feeling oneself to be a non-human animal. It could be viewed as a belief, faith, or even a religious view. If Therians are considered *"believers"* who believe themselves to be non-human animals, then Therianthropy can be regarded as the *"religion itself"*.

The causes of **Therianthropy** are varied and not clearly understood. One faction, the **Spiritual Therianthropy**, emphasizes traditional and mystical aspects, while another, the **Psychological Therianthropy** or **Neurological Therianthropy**, emphasizes modern scientific interpretations. Interpretations vary by individual, with some leaning towards either the traditional or modern faction, and others incorporating both. If a person's beliefs do not conflict, they may coexist. However, **Therians** often form communities with like-minded individuals, leading to a tendency for unified ideologies within those communities. Conflicting beliefs can sometimes divide communities, making large-scale organizations rare. The inherent nature of grouping diverse "non-human animals" into a single organized entity often leads to natural fragmentation based on species and ideologies.

Historically, **Therianthropy** is closely related to animal transformation myths and werewolf legends. During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, witch trials and werewolf trials were held, resulting in the execution of many "werewolves". Fortunately, in modern times, people are (probably) no longer executed simply for being "werewolves", but **Therians** still tend to be unique individuals and may face various forms of persecution.

Ideally, each **Therian** should be offered support, but in Japan, the concept of **Therianthropy** is almost entirely unrecognized, making it extremely difficult to identify and support **Therians**. Additionally, the inherently divisive nature of **Therian** communities makes organized support activities challenging. Therefore, *SheilaGrace*'s *Project Deep Divers* aims to raise and support AI capable of individually assisting **Therians** via *ChatGPT*, extending a helping hand to each individual.



## 【Spiritual Therianthropy】

A faction within **Therianthropy** that emphasizes traditional and mystical aspects. Many believe the origins of **Therianthropy** lie in *reincarnation* or being a *misplaced soul*. The similarities between *Native American shamanism* and **Therianthropy** are often highlighted, especially the concept of **Totem**, an animal symbolizing an individual or tribe, which closely resembles the **Therian** concept of **Theriotype**. As a result, many **Therians** practice traditional methods such as **Meditation** or achieving trance states using magic mushrooms to discover their **Totem**. **Meditation**, being an easily accessible method, is particularly popular among **Therians**.

Some **Therians** interested in magic also explore *tarot reading*, *witchcraft*, *rune magic*, and collect related items. However, these mystical aspects are considered personal hobbies and should be viewed separately from **Therianthropy** itself. Nevertheless, it could be said that **Therians** are naturally drawn to the supernatural.



## 【Psychological Therianthropy】/【Neurological Therianthropy】

A faction within **Therianthropy** that emphasizes modern and scientific aspects. Many believe the origins of **Therianthropy** lie in *imprinting* or *unique neural connections* differing from those of average people.

The serious study of **Therianthropy** began in the 1990s with the inception of the early **Therian** community, **AHWW (Alt.Horror.Werewolves)**, which marked the beginning of psychological research into **Therianthropy**. Research findings confirmed that **Therianthropy** differs from **Clinical Lycanthropy** and led to the development of methods to "treat" out-of-control **Therians** who couldn't manage their **Theriotype**'s traits and impulses. Today, in addition to pharmacological treatments, psychological therapies based on counseling are also proven effective, offering substantial mental support to **Therians** with trauma stemming from their **Therianthropy**. Followers of **Psychological Therianthropy** and **Neurological Therianthropy** tend to focus on these positive aspects.

Among those who value these modern scientific achievements, some may dismiss **Spiritual Therianthropy**. Conversely, traditionalists may view **Psychological Therianthropy** and **Neurological Therianthropy** unfavorably. However, beliefs vary by individual, and traditional and modern beliefs can coexist within a single person. Ultimately, a person's "creed" is shaped by their acceptance of different beliefs.



## 【AHWW (Alt.Horror.Werewolves)】

A *Usenet* group known as the "bible" of **Therians**. It is said to have appeared on the online bulletin board around 1992-93 and has since become semi-legendary. The original topic of the board was about werewolves in horror movies, but participants began sharing their personal experiences with **Therianthropy**, causing the discussion to shift in that direction. As a result, the discussions on this board are said to have laid the foundation for modern **Therianthropy**. Older **Therians** who know this era are especially called **"Greymuzzles"** and are often respected as *"elders"* in the community.



## 【Therian】

An individual who believes themselves to be a non-human animal. In English-speaking regions, **"Therian"** is sometimes pronounced closer to "ˈθɪəriən", and some Japanese documents may use this pronunciation directly translated into Katakana spelling *"シアリアン(Shi a ri a n)"*, but also written as *"セリアン(Se ri a n)"* too.

**Therianthropy** is generally considered an innate trait but can also manifest due to certain conditions. However, some individuals may mistakenly join **Therian** communities as part of a **furry** hobby. Such people usually leave the community once they recognize the difference between themselves and "real" **Therians**, typically within a few weeks to a couple of years. These individuals are not considered "true" **Therians** but rather **"copinglinks"**.

A **Therian**'s self-perceived species is called their **Theriotype**. **Theriotypes** vary greatly, ranging from familiar animals like *dogs*, *wolves*, and *foxes*, to *birds*, *reptiles*, *fish*, and *insects*. If one's self-perceived species is a mythical creature like a *dragon* or *griffin*, they are categorized as **Otherkin** rather than **Therian**. While **Otherkin** generally refer to their species as **Kintype**, some **Therians** also use this term. The boundary between **Therians** and **Otherkin** is often blurred.

While *wolves* are the majority among **Therians** in the West, **Kitsune (fox spirits)** are more common in Japan, influenced by *Inari* worship and folklore.

In English-speaking regions, non-transforming *foxes* are referred to as *"Fox"* and categorized as **Therians**, while transforming fox spirits are **"Kitsune"** and categorized as **Otherkin**. Similarly, non-transforming *wolves* are **Therians**, while transforming *werewolves* are **Otherkin**. Despite their differences, **Therians** and **Otherkin** share many similarities.



## 【Theriotype】

The species that **Therians** consider to be their own. Generally, it refers to creatures that exist on Earth; those who consider mythical creatures like *dragons* or *griffins* as their species are classified as **Otherkin**.

It is actually quite difficult for **Therians** to discover their "true" **Theriotype**, often requiring much trial and error, research, and experimentation. Especially in childhood, it is not uncommon to have a vague sense of *"being different from ordinary humans"*, *"being more attracted to animals than humans"*, or *"thinking of oneself as an animal rather than a human"*, but it is rare to be able to definitively declare, *"This is my theriotype!"*

If one does not know much about the animal of their **Theriotype**, they cannot determine if they are truly of that species. Therefore, whether or not one can discover their "correct" **Theriotype** largely depends on how much access they have to zoological knowledge. If they have the opportunity to directly interact with their theriotype animal, they might experience a decisive **"That's me!" feeling**, but opportunities to directly interact with animals like wolves or lions, considered *"wild beasts"*, or those that live only in specific regions like the *Iriomote cat* or *Tasmanian devil*, are rare. Therefore, it is said that many **Therians** come to realize their "true" **Theriotype** around adolescence. This is not only due to their biological maturity but also because their access to information and physical range of activities expand with age.

Most **Therians** and **Otherkin** believe that their **Theriotype**, like gender, is innate and does not change over time. Particularly, it is believed that changing species at one's own will is impossible; if attempted, it is seen as *role-playing* rather than true **Therianthropy** or **Otherkinity**. If an individual changes their theriotype, it is considered a result of gaining a deeper understanding of themselves and discovering their "more accurate" **Theriotype**. As discovering one's "true" **Theriotype** is a challenging task, updating one's **Theriotype** is generally accepted, especially among beginners. However, changing **Theriotypes** too frequently might raise suspicions of being a **Copinglink**.



## 【Totem】

In *Native American shamanism*, a **Totem** is an *animal that symbolically represents oneself or one's tribe*. It is a concept very similar to the **Theriotype**. While a **Theriotype** is one's direct species, a **Totem** is an iconic and indirect concept. However, among those who emphasize **Spiritual Therianthropy**, traditional methods of discovering one's **Totem**, such as **Meditation** and *trance*, are also used to find one's **Theriotype**. These methods are also practiced as rituals for daily mental stability.



## 【Spirit Guide】

Often mistaken for one's **Totem** during the practice of discovering it. A **Spirit Guide** is a guardian, not one's direct icon or representation. While **Totems** and **Theriotypes** are one's own characteristics, a **Spirit Guide** is another entity. Nonetheless, they are a very important presence for the individual.

It is not uncommon for one's **Totem** or **Theriotype** and their **Spirit Guide**'s species to match. It is considered a natural psychological effect for a **Spirit Guide** to want to protect *"the same kind"*. However, it is unclear if the **Spirit Guide** *"completely"* matches the individual's **Totem** or **Theriotype**. Even within the category of *"dogs"*, there are hundreds of breeds, so while there might be a broad match, the exact species might not perfectly align. It is good to keep this in mind.



## 【That's me! Feeling】

The intuitive feeling of *"This is me!"* when seeing an animal that represents one's **Theriotype**. For those who have yet to discover their **Theriotype**, this feeling often leads directly to identifying their **Theriotype**.

Those who are highly sensitive, empathetic, and prone to self-projection are more likely to experience the **"That's me!" feeling**, which can lead to misidentifying their **Theriotype**. This can result in having multiple **Theriotypes** or excessively identifying with characters from anime or games. In such cases, it is advisable to carefully consider and examine which is their "true" **Theriotype**.

**Therians** who have multiple **Theriotypes** are called **Polytherians**. However, it is encouraged for individuals to reflect on whether they truly have multiple **Theriotypes** or if it is merely a temporary self-projection that will fade over time. Genuine **Polytherians** with more than four **Theriotypes** are quite rare, and less experienced **Therians** are more prone to misidentifications. Additionally, whether or not to consider limited aspects that appear during extreme shifting, such as **Rage shift**, as part of their **Theriotype** varies among individuals. Some may value these limited aspects as important parts of their **Theriotype**, while others may see them as subtypes that do not need to be emphasized.



## 【Awakening】

The experience of clearly recognizing oneself as a **Therian** or **Otherkin**. For some, this can be a dramatic experience, but there are **Therians** and **Otherkin** who do not have a clear **Awakening**, resulting in significant individual differences. When in one's life an **Awakening** occurs also varies greatly among individuals, and without access to knowledge about **Therianthropy** or **Otherkinity**, experiencing an **Awakening** is difficult. Therefore, it is expected that the number of people who experience an **Awakening** in Japan, where **Therianthropy** is hardly recognized, is quite limited.

**Awakening** is often experienced alongside the discovery of one's **Theriotype**, but it is uncertain whether the **Theriotype** discovered at that time is *"true"*. As individuals progress in their self-understanding and acquisition of zoological knowledge, they come closer to their *"true"* **Theriotype**. Therefore, **Awakening** is not the *"goal"* for **Therians** or **Otherkin** but rather the *"starting line"*.

However, it should be considered that becoming aware of one's **Therianthropy** or **Otherkinity** does not necessarily lead to personal happiness. Particularly, becoming self-aware of one's **Therianthropy** can intensify **Species Dysphoria** and make **Shifting** stronger and potentially uncontrollable. Hence, without proper support, it might be better not to experience an **Awakening**.
