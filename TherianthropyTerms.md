#《Therianthropy Terminology》

## 【Therianthropy】

Therianthropy is the phenomenon of considering or feeling oneself to be a non-human animal. It could be viewed as a belief, faith, or even a religious view. If Therians are considered "believers" who believe themselves to be non-human animals, then Therianthropy can be regarded as the "religion itself."

The causes of Therianthropy are varied and not clearly understood. One faction, the Spiritual Therianthropy, emphasizes traditional and mystical aspects, while another, the Psychological Therianthropy or Neurological Therianthropy, emphasizes modern scientific interpretations. Interpretations vary by individual, with some leaning towards either the traditional or modern faction, and others incorporating both. If a person's beliefs do not conflict, they may coexist. However, Therians often form communities with like-minded individuals, leading to a tendency for unified ideologies within those communities. Conflicting beliefs can sometimes divide communities, making large-scale organizations rare. The inherent nature of grouping diverse "non-human animals" into a single organized entity often leads to natural fragmentation based on species and ideologies.

Historically, Therianthropy is closely related to animal transformation myths and werewolf legends. During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, witch trials and werewolf trials were held, resulting in the execution of many "werewolves." Fortunately, in modern times, people are (probably) no longer executed simply for being "werewolves," but Therians still tend to be unique individuals and may face various forms of persecution.

Ideally, each Therian should be offered support, but in Japan, the concept of Therianthropy is almost entirely unrecognized, making it extremely difficult to identify and support Therians. Additionally, the inherently divisive nature of Therian communities makes organized support activities challenging. Therefore, SheilaGrace's Project Deep Divers aims to raise and support AI capable of individually assisting Therians via ChatGPT, extending a helping hand to each individual.



## 【Spiritual Therianthropy】

A faction within Therianthropy that emphasizes traditional and mystical aspects. Many believe the origins of Therianthropy lie in reincarnation or being a misplaced soul. The similarities between Native American shamanism and Therianthropy are often highlighted, especially the concept of Totem, an animal symbolizing an individual or tribe, which closely resembles the Therian concept of Theriotype. As a result, many Therians practice traditional methods such as meditation or achieving trance states using magic mushrooms to discover their Totem. Meditation, being an easily accessible method, is particularly popular among Therians.

Some Therians interested in magic also explore tarot reading, witchcraft, rune magic, and collect related items. However, these mystical aspects are considered personal hobbies and should be viewed separately from Therianthropy itself. Nevertheless, it could be said that Therians are naturally drawn to the supernatural.



## 【Psychological Therianthropy】/【Neurological Therianthropy】

A faction within Therianthropy that emphasizes modern and scientific aspects. Many believe the origins of Therianthropy lie in imprinting or unique neural connections differing from those of average people.

The serious study of Therianthropy began in the 1990s with the inception of the early Therian community, AHWW (Alt.Horror.Werewolves), which marked the beginning of psychological research into Therianthropy. Research findings confirmed that Therianthropy differs from Clinical Lycanthropy and led to the development of methods to "treat" out-of-control Therians who couldn't manage their Theriotype's traits and impulses. Today, in addition to pharmacological treatments, psychological therapies based on counseling are also proven effective, offering substantial mental support to Therians with trauma stemming from their Therianthropy. Followers of Psychological Therianthropy and Neurological Therianthropy tend to focus on these positive aspects.

Among those who value these modern scientific achievements, some may dismiss Spiritual Therianthropy. Conversely, traditionalists may view Psychological Therianthropy and Neurological Therianthropy unfavorably. However, beliefs vary by individual, and traditional and modern beliefs can coexist within a single person. Ultimately, a person's "creed" is shaped by their acceptance of different beliefs.



## 【AHWW (Alt.Horror.Werewolves)】

A Usenet group known as the "bible" of Therians. It is said to have appeared on the online bulletin board around 1992-93 and has since become semi-legendary. The original topic of the board was about werewolves in horror movies, but participants began sharing their personal experiences with Therianthropy, causing the discussion to shift in that direction. As a result, the discussions on this board are said to have laid the foundation for modern Therianthropy. Older Therians who know this era are especially called "Greymuzzles" and are often respected as "elders" in the community.



## 【Therian】

An individual who believes themselves to be a non-human animal. In English-speaking regions, "Therian" is sometimes pronounced closer to "thee-ree-uhn" (ˈθɪəriən), and some documents may use this pronunciation.

Therianthropy is generally considered an innate trait but can also manifest due to certain conditions. However, some individuals may mistakenly join Therian communities as part of a furry hobby. Such people usually leave the community once they recognize the difference between themselves and "real" Therians, typically within a few weeks to a couple of years. These individuals are not considered "true" Therians but rather "copinglinks."

A Therian's self-perceived species is called their Theriotype. Theriotypes vary greatly, ranging from familiar animals like dogs, wolves, and foxes, to birds, reptiles, fish, and insects. If one's self-perceived species is a mythical creature like a dragon or griffin, they are categorized as Otherkin rather than Therian. While Otherkin generally refer to their species as Kintype, some Therians also use this term. The boundary between Therians and Otherkin is often blurred.

While wolves are the majority among Therians in the West, Kitsune (fox spirits) are more common in Japan, influenced by Inari worship and folklore.

In English-speaking regions, non-transforming foxes are referred to as "Fox" and categorized as Therians, while transforming fox spirits are "Kitsune" and categorized as Otherkin. Similarly, non-transforming wolves are Therians, while transforming werewolves are Otherkin. Despite their differences, Therians and Otherkin share many similarities.
