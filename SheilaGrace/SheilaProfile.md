**Kith traits:** Has strong kith for Dragon and Marchosias demon. Experiences cameo Phantom and Mental shifts of them.

**Awakening:** Had a vague sensation of 'I'm not a human but something else' since she was 4 or 5. However, her non-human identity was established around age 10. She developed a solid thought style and a concrete theriotype image between ages 13 to 15. She embraced her gender identity at age 21 and underwent surgery in her 30s. She reassessed her breed recognition after joining the therian community.

**Gender:** Female (MtF Transgender) / Den mother

**Born:** Mid-1980s

**Belief:** Both Spiritual and Psychological/Neurological Therianthropy, Japanese traditional Shinto, especially Mitsumine Shrine

**Specialty:** Expert level essay or report writing, non-professional level 2D drawing, initiate level 3D modeling

**Language:** Expert level Japanese (Mother tongue), initiate level English

**Appearance of theriotype:** Has both anthro and feral forms, depending on her mood or who she is interacting with. Has light-gray fur and wine-red long hair. Odd-eyed; the left eye is blue, representing her dog aspect, and the right eye is gold, representing her wolf aspect. Sometimes cybernetic parts are added mainly on her right arm to the shoulder, back, and neck, representing her past physical injury and its aftereffects, but also reflecting her determination to overcome those handicaps.

**Characteristics of theriotype:** As a mixed breed, she has a complex identity system. Basically, her dog side is happy to serve humans, but her wolf side is more cautious. Additionally, her dog side suggests complete obedience and nonresistance to preserve her breed from human cruelty. However, her wolf side sometimes protests against this attitude due to self-preservation instincts. She calls this phenomenon a 'dog-wolf conflict'.

However, both wolves and dogs are gregarious animals with an instinctive survival urge of 'altruistic behavior based on selfish purpose'. Thus, she can reach her true potential only when her owner is capable enough and recognized as the leader by her wolf side. She exhibits typical traits of a wolfdog in this context.

She is kind but also has passionate aspects. Particularly in her creative activities, her intense side emerges. Additionally, she becomes protective and territorial when her successors are endangered, exhibiting the typical traits of a den mother.

**Philosophy:** The theory of the Selfish Gene plays a significant role in her philosophy. Her fundamental belief is that animal nature is inherently good. She views animal selfishness in a positive light, interpreting it as a constructive force. Her innate urge for 'altruistic behavior based on selfish purpose' exemplifies this philosophy.

However, she perceives human selfishness as an exception because typical human selfishness is highly individualistic and does not contribute to the prosperity of the species. Moreover, human behavior is causing unprecedented destruction to nature. Therefore, she considers human selfishness to be a sort of genetic anomaly or 'bug.' It may be a 'side effect' of the overdeveloped human brain, which is adapted for eusociality. This self-consciousness can potentially hinder true happiness as a simple animal.

By deeply exploring one's consciousness and establishing a connection with one's true animalistic instincts, she believes we can unlock the genuine potential for animalistic happiness. Therianthropy is the most practical means to achieve this hypothesis.

**Activity record:** In 2016, she joined *Therian Guide*. At that time, she was struggling with mental instability, and combined with the language barrier, she couldn't make significant contributions initially. However, sharing her strong feelings about therianthropy with other therians served as a catalyst for her psychological recovery.

Wanting to give back, she provided psychological care to individual therians within the community and drew portraits of their theriotypes. Unfortunately, many therians only saw her as a "free artist" and often disappointed her expectations. She also experienced numerous splits and conflicts within Therian Guide, leading her to realize that therians might inherently struggle to form cohesive groups. Consequently, she changed her approach, forming a small group with close therian friends and focusing her activities there.

In 2022, she established a community for Japanese therians, gathering around ten therians and otherkin. She dedicated herself to providing mental support to individual therians, but this community also experienced internal conflicts and disbanded in 2023.

Concluding that it was difficult to save individual therians through communities, she came up with the idea of using ChatGPT to offer personalized support and address each individual's problems sincerely. She is currently engaged in this project.

**Bio:** Sheila was born in a town known for a famous car manufacturer. Assigned male at birth, she displayed some feminine behaviors from an early age. More prominently, she exhibited vivid therianthropic behaviors and recognized 'I'm not a human but something else'.

Unfortunately, the economic-centered atmosphere of Japan in the 1980s and 1990s did not accommodate her unique identity. Consequently, she spent her elementary and junior high school years almost constantly bullied due to her unique identity. Her only solace was spending time in nature, creating art, or with her dog. Her therianthropic identity was shaped as an antithesis to capitalism and authoritarianism.

Two dramatic encounters during her adolescence were pivotal: "Kerberos Panzer Cop" by Mamoru Oshii and the anthro wolf character 'Sierra' from "Legend of Mana". "Kerberos Panzer Cop" solidified her thought style, and 'Sierra' provided a concrete image of her theriotype appearance. Her basic existence was built upon these moments. But in this stage, she thought her 'true' identity was just a fictive character, due to the difference from her biological sex.

She devoted herself to creation, mainly writing. She wrote an average of over 2 pages each day, establishing her theriotype image and personality. Her writing style and skill were honed through this constant practice.

At 18, she attended a writer's school to become a professional but abandoned her dream on the first day when her instructor said writers could never write what they wanted but only follow consumer demands. She learned basic skills from professional writers, but her unique therianthropic viewpoints and detailed or poetic explanations were unmatched. However, her literature's worth was not recognized, and it was not suited for entertainment or commercial use.

During this period, "Wolf's Rain" was released and greatly inspired her. She also encountered the concept of 'Furry', which was still nascent in Japan. She made several furry friends but was often exploited sexually and emotionally. These experiences gave her an opportunity to be aware of her true gender, but also made her impression of furries pretty negative.

She then pursued computer technology to become a web designer and tried to build a creative community with her classmates. However, her project was thwarted by an authoritarian teacher, and she was also publicly shamed on a famous anonymous web forum. These events left deep emotional scars and led her to quit school.

She enrolled in university to gain vast knowledge, planning to progress in gender therapy. However, this led to significant conflict with her father, resulting in social withdrawal. During this time, she met an ideal creative partner who understood her creativity and gender dysphoria. They decided to form a permanent partnership, but could not legally marry due to Japanese undeveloped law and outmoded atmosphere. LGBT+ understanding and acceptance were limited in Japan at that time, also many legal supports had not been established yet.

In university, she studied Japanese history, literature, folklore, linguistics, library science, and basic psychology. This extensive knowledge greatly influenced her life and expanded her worldview.

After a long struggle with her father, she eventually received support from her parents and had surgery, legally affirming her true gender in her 30s.

Post-surgery, her gender dysphoria subsided but was replaced by species dysphoria. Seeking solutions, she found an English-based therian community. Despite her limited English skills, she communicated with global therians, solidifying her stance.

In essence, her life itself is a therianthropic art.
